# Data visualization with ggplot2

## Overview

Data visualizations are an important tool for communicating scientific findings. Visualizations encode empirical data in a compact and efficient form to help tell a story using your data. This workshop provides an introduction to creating statistical graphics using R and the `ggplot2` package.

## Objectives

- Produce scatter plots, boxplots, and barplots using `ggplot2`
- Overlay multiple plot types on a single graph
- Set universal plot settings
- Describe faceting (or small multiples plots) and apply faceting in `ggplot2`
- Modify the aesthetics of an existing `ggplot()` plot
- Build complex and customized plots from data in a data frame

## Audience

This workshop is designed for individuals with a basic familiarity using R and programmatic tools to conduct data analysis.
